         DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DECLARATION, DEFINATION AND INITIALIZATION
DECLARATION
Declaration is creating a variable –“declaring”.
You declare a variable with the var keyword.
     Example: var person;
  You declared that there’s a variable named person, but didn’t
  Define person so it’s undefined.
Note- After declaration, the variable has no value.

DEFINATION
Definition is to assign a value to the allocated place or memory.
       Example: var person = {};

INITIALIZATION
Initialization is the means of assigning an initial value to a variable.
It is initialized with some value.
          Example: var person =”Joy Wanja”;
Note – Undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.
